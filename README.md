## Description
  
Burger Logger is a fun and interactive application that lets users input and list the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Users will have the option to devour their burgers, or even regurgitate burgers that have already been devoured for re-consumption. Yuk! To each their own...

Construction of this application was an excellent introduction to full stack development, powered by MySql, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM!
